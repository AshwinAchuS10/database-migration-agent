# Migration Troubleshooting Guide

## Common Issues and Solutions

### 1. Data Migration Issues

**Problem:** Record count mismatch between SQL and MongoDB
**Symptoms:**
- Validation scripts report different record counts
- Application shows missing data

**Solutions:**
1. Check for data type conversion issues
2. Verify filter conditions in migration scripts
3. Check for NULL value handling
4. Review transaction boundaries

**Prevention:**
- Test migration scripts with sample data
- Implement comprehensive logging
- Use batch processing for large datasets

### 2. Performance Issues

**Problem:** Slow query performance in MongoDB
**Symptoms:**
- High response times
- CPU/memory usage spikes
- Timeout errors

**Solutions:**
1. Review and optimize indexes
2. Check query patterns and structure
3. Consider denormalization for frequently accessed data
4. Implement connection pooling

**Prevention:**
- Design indexes based on query patterns
- Monitor performance during migration
- Load test the new system

### 3. Application Integration Issues

**Problem:** Application errors after migration
**Symptoms:**
- Connection errors
- Data format issues
- Functionality failures

**Solutions:**
1. Update connection strings and drivers
2. Modify data access code for NoSQL patterns
3. Update data validation logic
4. Test all application workflows

**Prevention:**
- Comprehensive application testing
- Gradual rollout strategy
- Maintain backward compatibility where possible

## Emergency Procedures

### Immediate Response
1. **Assess Impact:** Determine scope and severity
2. **Notify Team:** Alert technical team and stakeholders
3. **Document Issue:** Record symptoms and timeline
4. **Implement Workaround:** If possible, implement temporary solution

### Escalation Procedures
1. **Level 1:** Technical team investigation
2. **Level 2:** Senior technical team involvement
3. **Level 3:** Vendor support or external consultation
4. **Level 4:** Executive escalation

### Rollback Decision Criteria
Consider rollback if:
- Data integrity cannot be maintained
- Performance degradation is severe
- Application functionality is compromised
- User experience is significantly impacted

## Monitoring and Alerting

### Key Metrics to Monitor
- Database connection count
- Query response times
- Error rates
- Data validation results
- Application performance metrics

### Alert Thresholds
- Response time > 2 seconds
- Error rate > 1%
- Connection failures > 5%
- Data validation failures
