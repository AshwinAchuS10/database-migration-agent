# SQL to NoSQL Database Migration Guide

## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive guide for migrating from SQL to NoSQL database architecture. The migration involves transforming relational data structures into document-based collections optimized for MongoDB.

**Migration Date:** 2024-01-15 10:30:00
**Source Database:** SQL Database
**Target Database:** MongoDB
**Complexity Level:** Medium

## Migration Summary

- **Total Tables:** 5
- **Total Collections:** 5
- **Estimated Duration:** 7-10 days
- **Migration Strategy:** Phased approach with validation

## Pre-Migration Checklist

### 1. Environment Preparation

- [ ] Set up MongoDB cluster
- [ ] Configure network connectivity
- [ ] Install required tools and drivers
- [ ] Create backup of source database
- [ ] Set up monitoring and logging

### 2. Data Analysis

- [ ] Analyze data volume and growth patterns
- [ ] Identify data access patterns
- [ ] Review data quality and integrity
- [ ] Document business rules and constraints

## Migration Phases

### Phase 1: Preparation and Setup
**Duration:** 1-2 days
**Description:** Set up target database, create collections, and prepare migration environment

**Tasks:**
- Create MongoDB database and collections
- Set up indexes as defined in mapping
- Prepare migration scripts and tools
- Set up monitoring and logging

### Phase 2: Data Migration - Core Tables
**Duration:** 2-3 days
**Description:** Migrate core business tables with minimal dependencies

**Tasks:**
- Migrate lookup and reference tables
- Migrate core entity tables
- Validate data integrity
- Test basic functionality

## Post-Migration Validation

### Data Integrity Checks
- Record count validation
- Data type validation
- Relationship integrity validation
- Constraint validation

### Performance Validation
- Query performance testing
- Index effectiveness validation
- Load testing
- Response time benchmarking

## Rollback Procedures

In case of migration issues, follow these rollback steps:

1. **Immediate Actions**
   - Stop application traffic to new database
   - Alert technical team
   - Assess impact and severity

2. **Data Rollback**
   - Restore from pre-migration backup
   - Validate data integrity
   - Restart services with original database

3. **Application Rollback**
   - Revert application configuration
   - Update connection strings
   - Restart application services

## Support and Maintenance

### Monitoring
- Set up database monitoring
- Configure alerting for critical issues
- Monitor performance metrics

### Documentation Updates
- Update API documentation
- Revise user manuals
- Update system architecture diagrams
