# SQL to NoSQL Database Migration Multi-Agent System

A comprehensive Multi-Agent System that automates the migration of databases from SQL to NoSQL architectures using specialized AI agents for analysis, planning, and execution.

## Problem Statement

Database migration from SQL to NoSQL systems is a complex process that requires deep understanding of both relational and document-based data models. Traditional migration approaches are often manual, error-prone, and lack the sophistication needed to optimize data structures for NoSQL systems. This system addresses these challenges by using specialized AI agents that collaborate to:

- Analyze complex SQL schemas and relationships
- Design optimal NoSQL document structures
- Create detailed migration plans with validation procedures
- Generate comprehensive documentation and implementation scripts

## Tech Stack

## Multi-Agent System Design

### The Crew (Agents)

#### 1. Schema Analyzer Agent
- **Role:** Database Schema Analyst
- **Goal:** Analyze SQL database schema to understand structure, relationships, and constraints for NoSQL migration planning
- **Backstory:** Expert database architect with 15+ years of experience in both SQL and NoSQL databases, specializing in analyzing complex relational database schemas and understanding how they can be optimally restructured for document-based NoSQL systems.

#### 2. Data Mapper Agent
- **Role:** Data Structure Mapping Specialist
- **Goal:** Map SQL table structures to optimal NoSQL document structures for efficient data access and storage
- **Backstory:** Senior data architect with extensive experience in both relational and NoSQL databases, excelling at understanding data access patterns and designing document structures that optimize for read performance while maintaining data integrity.

#### 3. Migration Planner Agent
- **Role:** Database Migration Strategist
- **Goal:** Create comprehensive migration plans with detailed scripts, validation steps, and rollback procedures for SQL to NoSQL database migration
- **Backstory:** Senior database migration specialist with 20+ years of experience in large-scale database migrations, having successfully migrated hundreds of databases from SQL to NoSQL systems, handling everything from small applications to enterprise-level systems with millions of records.

#### 4. Documentation Agent
- **Role:** Technical Documentation Specialist
- **Goal:** Create comprehensive, clear, and actionable documentation for the SQL to NoSQL migration process and resulting system
- **Backstory:** Senior technical writer with 15+ years of experience documenting complex database migrations and system architectures, excelling at translating technical concepts into clear, actionable documentation.

### The Process (Tasks & Workflow)

The system follows a sequential workflow where agents collaborate in the following order:

1. **Schema Analysis Phase**
   - Schema Analyzer Agent analyzes SQL database structure
   - Identifies relationships, constraints, and data patterns
   - Assesses migration complexity and provides recommendations

2. **Data Mapping Phase**
   - Data Mapper Agent processes schema analysis results
   - Maps SQL tables to NoSQL collections
   - Designs document structures and relationship strategies
   - Suggests indexes and embedding strategies

3. **Migration Planning Phase**
   - Migration Planner Agent creates detailed migration plan
   - Generates migration scripts and validation procedures
   - Defines rollback procedures and risk assessment
   - Estimates timeline and resource requirements

4. **Documentation Generation Phase**
   - Documentation Agent generates comprehensive documentation
   - Creates migration guides, API documentation, and user manuals
   - Produces troubleshooting guides and technical specifications

### The Outcome

The system generates a complete migration package including:

- **Schema Analysis Report** - Detailed analysis of SQL database structure and complexity
- **Data Mapping Documentation** - NoSQL collection designs and relationship strategies
- **Migration Scripts** - Python scripts for data migration and MongoDB setup
- **Validation Scripts** - Comprehensive data integrity and performance validation
- **Documentation Suite** - Migration guides, API docs, user manuals, and troubleshooting guides
- **Risk Assessment** - Detailed risk analysis with mitigation strategies
- **Rollback Procedures** - Complete rollback plan for migration failures

## Why a Multi-Agent System?

This problem requires a Multi-Agent System rather than a single monolithic AI call for several key reasons:

### 1. **Specialization and Expertise**
Each agent has deep, specialized knowledge in their domain:
- Schema analysis requires expertise in database design patterns and normalization
- Data mapping needs understanding of NoSQL optimization and access patterns
- Migration planning requires experience with large-scale system migrations
- Documentation demands technical writing and user experience skills

### 2. **Modularity and Maintainability**
- Each agent can be updated independently as new techniques emerge
- Specialized agents can be reused for different migration scenarios
- System can be extended with additional agents for specific requirements

### 3. **Fault Tolerance and Reliability**
- If one agent fails, others can continue with partial results
- Each agent validates its own output before passing to the next
- System can retry individual agent tasks without full restart

### 4. **Complex Problem Decomposition**
- Database migration involves multiple complex sub-problems
- Each agent focuses on solving one aspect optimally
- Sequential processing ensures each step builds on previous results

### 5. **Quality Assurance**
- Multiple agents provide different perspectives on the same data
- Cross-validation between agents improves output quality
- Specialized agents catch domain-specific issues

## How to Run

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd sql-to-nosql-migration-mas
```

2. **Create virtual environment:**
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. **Install dependencies:**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

    "tables": [
        # Your table definitions
    ]

results = workflow.execute_migration_workflow(custom_schema)
```

3. **Run individual agents:**
```python
from agents import SchemaAnalyzerAgent, DataMapperAgent
